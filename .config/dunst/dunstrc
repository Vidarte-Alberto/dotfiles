    # --- IMPORTANT: DUNST SHORTCUTS ---
    # It's generally more robust to bind these shortcuts in your window manager (Qtile)
    # using 'dunstctl' commands.
    # If you still want to use Dunst's internal shortcuts, ensure the key names are correct
    # as identified by 'xev'. Replace 'grave' with the actual key name if different.
    # close = ctrl+grave      # Example. Replace 'grave' with actual key name if needed.
    # close_all = ctrl+shift+grave # Example. Replace 'grave' with actual key name if needed.
    # history = ctrl+grave    # Example. Replace 'grave' with actual key name if needed.
    # context = ctrl+shift+grave # Example. Replace 'grave' with actual key name if needed.
